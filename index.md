title: Machine Learning and Analysis for Twitter Bot Detection
---

####Motivation:
There are an average of 6,000 tweets produced on Twitter per second. Twitter posts are mostly
public and can be easily collected using Twitterâ€™s developer platform API. Also, frequent use of
hashtags makes it more interesting to draw conclusions.
The role of so-called social media "bots" automated accounts capable of posting content or interact-
ing with other users with no direct human involvement has been the subject of much scrutiny and
attention in recent years [1]. These accounts can play a valuable part in the social media ecosystem
by answering questions about a variety of topics in real time or providing automated updates about
news stories or events. At the same time, they can also be used to attempt to alter perceptions
of political discourse on social media, spread misinformation, or manipulate online rating and
review systems [2]. As social media has attained an increasingly prominent position in the overall
news and information environment, bots have been swept up in the broader debate over Ameri-
cans changing news habits, the tenor of online discourse and the prevalence of fake news online [3].
In order to detect bots, classification models and/or natural language processing techniques such
as topic modeling and sentiment analysis can be incorporated. This project will involve feature
engineering and will provide a real-world data collection experience.

#####Questions:
1. Can machine learning algorithms be applied to classify bot or human activity based on user-level and/or
tweet-level data?
2. Can engineered features based on NLP techniques improve bot prediction accuracy?
