##### Motivation:
The role of so-called social media "bots" automated accounts capable of posting content or interact-
ing with other users with no direct human involvement has been the subject of much scrutiny and
attention in recent years. These bosts can also be used to attempt to alter perceptions
of political discourse on social media, spread misinformation, or manipulate online rating and
review systems. In the 2016 election, Twitter bots were shaping the outcome of the election. 
A recent study by Times, Twitter Bots may have boosted Trump's votes by 3.23%. During the Brexit 2016,
the bots may have added 1.76% point to "pro-leave" votes[6].

We want to automate the identification of these social bots through machine learning using just tweet 
data. By accurately identify these social bots tweets, it will provide an effective weapon to curb 
propaganda, disinformation, and provocation [8]. 
 

##### Questions:
1. Can machine learning algorithms be applied to classify bot or human activity based on tweets?
2. Can engineered features based on NLP techniques improve bot prediction accuracy?
